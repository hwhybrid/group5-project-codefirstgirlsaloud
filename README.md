## What this website does

This is a **book recommendation** website. This site solves the problem of what to read next: users can search for books by genre and a list of 10 books (rated at 4 stars or higher) will be returned.

<br>

## Our must haves

The **MVP (Minimum Viable Product).** These are the absolute essentials:

<br>

📗 Accepts user input of genres

📙 In-built filters to return books of 4 stars and above

📘 Returns output of a reading list with 10 recommendations

📕 Book covers, titles, authors, and synopses presented for each item on list

<br>

## Our should haves

We should definitely do these if there's time:

<br>

📗 Optional filtering options: language, subject, book length, year published and age rating

📙 Export to PDF/print/email list options

📘 More information page – clicking a book from the list will take you to a page containing further details

📕 Ability to add or remove books to a saved reading list

<br>

## Our could haves

**Would be nice to have but not essential:**

<br>

📗 User login storing search history, previously generated lists, future reading list

📙 Link account to GoodReads, Google Account – export list option to associated accounts

📘 “Show me more”/”Remove from recommendations” buttons

📕 “I’ve read this” button for books the user has already read (removes from future recommendation lists)

📗 Sample passage generation – presents the user with a short sample from book to preview

📙 Where to buy links with pricing

📘 Caching API requests from Google to reduce overhead and optimise performance

📕 User settings – advanced customisation options e.g. “Include read books in future lists” and “Default language”
