## Get started 

**1. Clone the repository**

---

**2. Install Dependencies**

Before you start, make sure you have the required packages installed. Open a terminal/command prompt and [navigate to your project directory](#command-line-101) . Run the following command to install the required packages listed in your requirements.txt file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

**3. Run the Flask App**

main.py is the main entry point of the Flask application. You can run the app by executing the following command in the terminal/command prompt within your project directory:

```bash
python main.py
```

This should start your Flask app and make it accessible at the local address http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

---

**4. Access the Website**

Open a web browser and navigate to the URL http://127.0.0.1:5000/. You should see your Flask application's home page.

> ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ Flask provides a local server that is intended for **testing and development purposes only**. [Read about security considerations here.](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.3.x/security/) ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ ⚠️ </details>

## Command line 101

**1. Open terminal** 

Open the terminal (MacOS & Linux) or command prompt (Windows) on your computer. This is the command-line interface where you can type commands.

--- 

**2. Your current location**

When you open the terminal, you're typically in your user's "home" directory. You can verify your current location by typing the following command and pressing Enter:

```bash
pwd
```

---

**3. Changing directory**

To navigate to a specific directory, you use the cd command followed by the path to the directory you want to navigate to. For example, to navigate to the directory "CFGProject":

```bash
cd /path/to/CFGProject
```

You can also cd into a directory one by one. For example:

```bash
cd Documents
```

```bash
cd CFGProject
```

---

**4. Listing Contents**

Once you've navigated to a directory, you can list its contents using the ls command:

```bash
ls
```

This will display the files and directories within the current directory.

**5. Navigating Up**

To navigate back to the parent directory (the directory containing your current directory), use:

```bash
cd ..
```

---

**6. Navigating Home**

To return to your user's home directory, simply use cd without any arguments:

```bash
cd
```
